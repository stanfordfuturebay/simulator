# A Spatiotemporal Epidemic Model to Quantify The Effects of Testing, Contact Tracing and Containment

This repository contains scripts and notebooks to run the sampling algorithm of a high resolution spatiotemporal epidemic model, which can be used to predict the spread of COVID-19 under different testing & tracing strategies, social distancing measures and business restrictions in an arbitrary city/town. Details about the relevant theory and methods can be found in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07641).

## Project description

We introduce a modeling framework for studying epidemics that is specifically designed to make use of fine-grained spatiotemporal data. Motivated by the availability of data from contact tracing technologies and the current COVID-19 outbreak, our model uses marked temporal point processes to represent individual mobility patterns and the course of the disease for each individual in a population.

The sampling algorithm provided in this repository can be used to predict the spread of COVID-19 under different testing & tracing strategies, social distancing measures and business restrictions, given location or contact histories of individuals. Moreover, it gives a detailed representation of the disease's effect on each individual through time, distinguishing between several known states like asymptomatic, presymptomatic, symptomatic or recovered.

Additionally, an inference script based on Bayesian Optimization allows the estimation of the risk of exposure of each individual at sites, the percentage of symptomatic individuals, and the difference in transmission rate between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals from historical longitudinal testing data.

The notebooks in this repository are focused on real COVID-19 data and mobility patterns from TÃ¼bingen, a town in the Southwest of Germany, but can be easily parameterized and used for generating realistic mobility patterns and simulating the spread of a disease for any given city/town.
